# Insta-Streaks
Makes country streak counters show the streak count instantaneously.

1. Click here to install Insta-Streaks script for Tampermonkey and Chrome.
2. Click here to install Simple Reverse Geocoding Script for instant preformance.
3. In the country streak script, make sure ```//grant none``` is at the top in the header, this is required for Insta-Streaks to work. If it isn't you will need to type it in manually (see picture). If you see any other ```\\@grant``` in the header it will need to be replaced, for example: ```\\@grant GM_addStyle``` should be replaced with ```\\@grant none```; in the case that messes up the country streak counter you will have to decide what to do.
